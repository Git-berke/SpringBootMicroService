Notification Microservice with Spring Boot
Overview
This project is a Spring Boot-based notification microservice that we developed to strengthen my understanding of Spring Boot and its ecosystem. Through this project, I have gained hands-on experience in building a fully functional and scalable microservice using modern development practices.

Key Features
Developed a notification microservice using Spring Boot, showcasing clean and modular architecture.
Incorporated essential Spring Boot principles and design patterns, such as Controller-Service-Repository and DTO layers, to ensure maintainability and scalability.
Enabled smooth database migrations using Flyway, ensuring version control for database schemas.
Technologies and Tools
The project utilizes the following technologies and tools to deliver a robust solution:

PostgreSQL: Database management and integration.
Docker: Containerization for consistent development and deployment environments.
JPA & Hibernate: Object-relational mapping (ORM) for seamless interaction with the database.
Flyway: Database migration tool to manage schema changes.
Testing: Test writing and execution to ensure the reliability of the service.
Key Learnings
Hands-on experience with Spring Boot and its ecosystem.
Implemented a layered architecture with Controller, Service, and Repository patterns.
Understood and applied the DTO (Data Transfer Object) pattern to handle data efficiently between layers.
Used Docker to containerize the application, making it portable and easy to deploy.
Practiced writing unit and integration tests to ensure the quality of the application.
